## Healthcare Utilization

This is a batch model using Arthur's v3 API & SDK, using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data.
We use the raw data files and preprocessing provided by [IBM AIF360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/blob/master/aif360/data/raw/meps/README.md).

The prediction task is to determine whether an individual will have *high* utilization
of the healthcare system---that is, visit a medical professional 10 or more times---or
*low* utilization.

The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how Arthur can be used with an
external model; we do not need access to the actual model, only the inputs and predictions
associated with it. Therefore, the notebook itself does not include any of the training steps,
nor does it generate inferences. Rather, `data/fulldata_train.parquet` contains the
data that was used to train the underlying predictive model, which is saved in `saved_model/skl_lr.joblib`
for reference (but never used or accessed by the notebook or `ArthurModel`).
The inferences generated by the model, as well as the inputs used to generate
those inferences, are stored in `data/x_shift`. Each `.parquet` file in `data/x_shift`
represents the inferences generated at a separate batch. The inputs were intentionally
perturbed, so that data drift can be observed from batch 1 to batch 8.

To run this notebook, you will need the Arthur SDK installed. Contact an Arthur engineer if
you are having issues with the installation or with the imports at the top of the notebook.
