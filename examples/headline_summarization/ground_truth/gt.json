Where am I going to live?

so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine.\nPrevious research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing.\nBut animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell.\nThese are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high.\nDr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\"\nThere were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments.\nType 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin.\nFurther tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects.\nDr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes.\n\"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\"\nBBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo.\nHe said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs).\n\"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight.\n\"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\"\nHis blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers.\nHe said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\"\nPeter Bowes: Fasting for science\nPeter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body\nSeparate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels.

France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be

to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme.\nHouvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures.\nThe report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment.\nBritish Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview.\nBoth Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling.\nHouvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture.\nA government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently.\nIt is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies.\nHouvenaghel claimed:\nBritish Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\".\nIt said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\".\nThe statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\"\nWho else has spoken out?\nHouvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011.\nShe retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury.\nHouvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission.\nAt the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\".\nHe added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\"\nBritish Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\".\nOther elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling.\nAsked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\n\"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\n\"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\"\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\n\"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\""}, "partner_inference_id": "6-2023-03-17"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:47:11.908344+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "It's no joke.

But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed.

Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead.\nAttempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear.\n\"I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.

He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this.\nMr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump.\nHe said: \"What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!\"\n\"I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time.\"\nThe idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field.\n\"It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other,\" said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado.\n\"This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook"}, "partner_inference_id": "16-2023-03-22"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:47:55.277263+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "The ska group tweeted the news: \"It is with deep regret that we say goodbye to our great friend, the world's greatest drummer, our beloved Brad.

He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\nOpting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\nAlthough it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\nAs well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\nThough he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\nSo, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\nMurray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\nIt would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\nYet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\nHe has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\nThis year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\nHe claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\nBut perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\nThat may not be a concern much longer.\nMurray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\nIn fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\nNadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\nAnd then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device"}, "partner_inference_id": "27-2023-03-30"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:48:34.736348+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "Mandla Hlatshwayo and his friend were shot after confronting a group of men who had robbed women of their mobile phones in a pub in Soweto.\nThe suspects were found in possession of drugs and an unlicensed gun.\nSouth Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world with more than 50,000 cases reported every year.\n\"Police are questioning the suspects to see if they can link them to the shooting,\" says the police's Lungelo Dlamini.\nTributes are still pouring in for the star who was also a DJ on local radio station Jozi FM.\nThose who knew the 40-year-old have described him as a selfless man."}, "partner_inference_id": "28-2023-03-31"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:48:37.466468+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "Witnesses told officers they heard a gun being fired near Anfield Road Primary School at about 09:00 GMT.\nPupils and staff there and at the nearby All Saints Catholic Primary School have been ordered to stay indoors while police investigate.\nCh Supt Mark Harrison said it \"beggars belief\" it would happen at a school.\nMembers of the public told police the shot was fired at a dark coloured car by a white man in a grey hooded top who was on foot.\nA Merseyside Police spokeswoman said local hospitals had been checked and \"no-one has sought medical attention for injuries caused by a firearm\".\nShe said officers were making house-to-house inquiries and studying CCTV footage of the area.\nCh Supt Harrison said the attack \"appears to be targeted\" and was particularly worrying as \"a child could have been seriously injured or worse\".\nHe said police wanted to hear from those inside the car \"so we know they are safe\".\nAnfield Road Primary School's headteacher Clair Drew-Williams said her pupils were \"safe and unaware of the incident\".\n\"The site was not evacuated, the school day is continuing as normal and a trip for some pupils took place as planned,\" she said."}, "partner_inference_id": "29-2023-03-31"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:48:41.005156+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "The Olympic champion, 29, was third overall at the end of a promising first day -

No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'\n\"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\"\nJust as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\".\nBut James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\".\n\"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.\n\"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\"\nThis is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says.\n\"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.\n\"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\"\nJames has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\".\nCate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.\n\"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\"\nBranagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.\n\"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.\n\"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.\n\"And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring.\"\nCinderella is out in the UK on 27 March."}, "partner_inference_id": "39-2023-04-05"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:49:17.432563+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "But one nation, Russia, was missing.\nFor the first time in Eurovision history, the host nation barred another country's singer.\nThat is because in 2015, in violation of Ukrainian border rules, Russia's Julia Samoilova performed in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia a year earlier.\nSamoilova suffers from a neural muscular disorder and has used a wheelchair since childhood.\n\"When the rumours began I might not go, I was so sad,\" she told the BBC in Moscow. \"I thought, how come?

Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal.\"\nThe ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nEurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went \"against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values\".\nIn an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow.\nRussia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise.\nUkraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population.\nRussia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play.

They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game.\"\nIn the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that \"we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot.\"\nSecurity in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final.\nAs for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea.

The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.\n\"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times.\n\"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement.

They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\n\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\n\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\n\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\n\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\n\"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\n\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\n\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\n\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\n\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.\n\"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.\n\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.\n\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\n\"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them.

To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.\nHe was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.\nHis message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia.\nHis concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.\nMeasured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.\nThe much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.\nBut it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.\nThe democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled.\nSince the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.\nWhy West will miss Meles\nObituary: Meles Zenawi\nLife in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi\nA plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.\nFeeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.\nHe orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.\nHis death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.\nThat said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.\nThe opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.\nMr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.\nHe is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.\nHe did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.\nNot in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.\nFrom the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.\nMany embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nThe Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.\nHe swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.\nThe two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.\nHostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.\nIt is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.\nThat would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.\nIn Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.\nThe death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.\nThere are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.\nSuch fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.\nHowever, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia."}, "partner_inference_id": "43-2023-04-08"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:49:33.327249+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "Only 50.5 overs were possible at the MCG, but Australia still got wickets at regular intervals with Jackson Bird taking two for 53.\nAzhar's 110-ball half-century saw him pass 1,000 Test runs in 2016.\nAustralia lead the three-Test series 1-0, having beaten Pakistan by 39 runs in the opener at the Gabba.\nSami Aslam was undone by Nathan Lyon after making just nine and, after Azhar and Babar Azam batted through the remainder of the morning, Azam edged the last ball before lunch from Josh Hazlewood to give Steve Smith his second catch.\nMisbah-ul-Haq scored 11 off 13 balls with a four and a six before being brilliantly caught at short leg by Nic Maddinson off Bird.\nBird bowled Younus Khan off an inside edge to end a third-wicket stand of 51.\nThe wicket came shortly before the scheduled tea break and the weather meant that interval came early and play never resumed."}, "partner_inference_id": "44-2023-04-09"}, {"ground_truth_timestamp": "2023-04-12T01:49:36.365834+00:00", "ground_truth_data": {"summary": "It was the first time the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system had been used to select two members in the same ward in a by-election.\nThe SNP topped the vote in the Leith Walk by-election, while Scottish Labour won the second seat from the Greens.\nThe by-election was called after Deidre Brock of the SNP and Maggie Chapman of the Scottish Greens stood down.\nThe SNP's John Lewis Ritchie topped the Leith Walk poll with 2,290 votes.

Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction.\nBut they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments.\nThe most recent figures show \u00a376bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years.\nFrom this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the \u00a310,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%.\nAnd the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors.\nUnder Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government.\nBut is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged?\nUniversities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion.\nOne of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates.\nThe argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees.\nThis year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased.\nBut the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration.\nAlthough wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest.\nDo students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects?\nDepartment for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned \u00a310,000 per year more.\nAmong younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at \u00a36,000 per year.\nBut the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade.\nLabour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters.\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections.\nThe survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote.\nThe Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives.\nIs this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government?\nCould they really entirely scrap fees?\nThere will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees.\nGermany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees.\nFrench undergraduates can study for low fees.\nIn the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about \u00a3100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.\nThere are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.\nAnd the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland.\nFor England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades."}, "partner_inference_id": "49-2023-04-12"}]
